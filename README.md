# CS50 Python Mastery – Guided by Arun Prakash

I'm on a 3-month journey to master Python, mentored by Arun Prakash — a senior data scientist and an amazing mentor.  
This repo documents my progress through Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python.

✅ Each subfolder = one lecture  
✅ One mini project per lecture to apply key concepts  
✅ Public progress for accountability and feedback .
