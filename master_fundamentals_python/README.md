# Master Fundamentals Python

This folder contains my hands-on learning based on the **Master Fundamentals of Python** playlist recommended by my mentor [Arun Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunprakash-ai/).

ðŸŽ¥ Playlist: [Master Fundamentals Python - YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVyhfExBT1XC-5ls9DezJIqioVYhf-09t&si=kKyUj-V-HcslFN7g)

## Purpose
To deepen my understanding of Python fundamentals using Jupyter notebooks alongside Harvard's CS50 Python course.

## Structure
Each notebook covers a specific concept from the playlist. This is tracked separately from CS50 projects for clarity.
